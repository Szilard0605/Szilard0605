<h3 align="center">Hey ðŸ‘‹</h3>

My name is _SzilÃ¡rd KÃ¡tai_, I live in _Hungary_ and i really like programming.
I usully make anything that comes to my mind. I really like to work with C++, C, but
I worked with other languages as well, like C#, Lua, Python, and JavaScript. 

I'm currently working on a Game Engine, and my goal is to publish a multiplayer game which 
is built with this Game Engine.
